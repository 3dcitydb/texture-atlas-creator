3. About
--------

This program is a standalone tool for modifying CityGML files and 
making texture atlases for all entire buildings.
It will compact several (as much as possible) texture images together
into one or several atlases (depending on atlas' size settings) and 
adapt texture coordinates accordingly. As a result the overall size 
of the resources (both CityGML and texture image files) will be 
significantly decreased. In addition, as an effect of using texture 
atlases the loading time of modified CityGML files will considerably 
decreased in viewers.
  
Features:
	* For each building, group textures, which have similar properties,
	to one or more texture atlases.
	* Maximum atlas size as an input.
	* Five different packing algorithms.  	
	* Accepts a folder as an input and parses it and its sub-folders 
	for valid CityGML files.
	* Detailed output shown in console. 
	* Different image formats as input like RGB, JPEG, PNG.
	* Different image output formats based on transparency of its content.

Different packing algorithms:
	TPIM:
		TPIM is customized version of Touching Perimeter algorithm 
		as a heuristic two-dimensional bin packing with support of rotation. 
		During tests 83.35% of result atlas was occupied. This algorithm is 
		based on source code developed and released to the public by Jukka JylÃ¤nki.
					
		TPIM starts by sorting the items according to non-increasing area and 
		their normal orientation. It initializes a bin with maximume acceptable 
		size and packs one item at a time. In the case that it is not possible 
		to add a new item to the current bin, a new bin will be initialized. The first 
		item packed in a bin is always placed in the bottom left corner. However 
		in the result atlas the origin will be in the top left corner. Each item is 
		packed in a way that its bottom and left edges touching either the the bin 
		or the edge of another item.

		Each potential position for the new item will be scored as the amount 
		of its touching edges. Touching the bin edges is more valuable to avoid 
		inhomogeneous shape of bin. For each candidate (position) the score will be 
		calculated twice (normal orientation and 90 degree rotated) and the highest 
		value will be taken.

		Lodi A, Martello S, Vigo D. Heuristic and Metaheuristic Approaches 
		for a Class of Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problems. INFORMS J on 
		Computing 1999;11:345-357.
		
	TPIM_WITHOUT_ROTATION:
		It is an extension of TPIM algorithm which does not rotate textures.
			
	SLEA:
		Sleator's algorithm is a two-dimentional bin packing. It starts by packing
		all the items which has a width greater than half of the bin's width on top of
		each other. Then the remaining items will be sorted according to non-increasing
		height. 
		The bin will be split to two halves. Next items will be placed from left to right 
		in the left half and when it can not accommodate, the left half will be close and items 
		will be placed in right half. Next level of halves, will be started with different 
		bottom height according to maximum height in previous level of left and right side.

		For more information please refer to:
		D. Sleator , A 2.5 times optimal algorithm for packing in two
		dimensions. Information Processing Letters 10 (1980), pp. 37-40.

	NFDH:
		The Next-Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) algorithm starts by sorting items according 
		to non-increasing height. Then it packs a next item, left side, 
		on the current level if it fits. Otherwise, the level will be closed, and a new level 
		will be created (as a horizontal line drawn on the top of the tallest item packed 
		on the current level), and the item is packed, left justified, on it.

	 	problems: A survey, European Journal of Operational Research, 141, issue 2, p. 241-252
	 
	FFDH:
		The First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) algorithm starts by sorting items according 
		to non-increasing height. It packs the next item, left justified, on the first level 
		where it fits. If there is not any level to accommodate it, a new level is created
		as in NFDH.

RGB Endocder:
	The SGI RGB Image format is supported by this API. An encoder is developed based on file format
	specification version 1.00 written by Paul Haeberli from Silicon Graphics Computer Systems.
	The encoder supports most of RGB images, but not all of them. For more information about the
	file format please refer to http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/sgirgb/sgiversion.html (active 
	in 2011).
		
Notes:	
	* Wrapping textures, which have a coordinate out of the range [0,1],
	will not be modified.
	* TexCoordGen and GeoreferencedTexture are not supported.
	* Input CityGML files MUST be well-formed and validated based on 
	its official schema.	
	
	
4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.5
* 1GB Main Memory 
	- Otherwise modify the BATCH file by changing -Xms1024m and -Xmx1024m
	to maximum possible size depending on your system.

  
5. How to use it
----------------

Simply run the batch file with options according to your desired result.

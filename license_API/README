3. About
--------
textureAtlas is a Java class library and API for compacting several
texture images together into one or several atlases (depending on 
atlas' size settings) and adapting texture coordinates accordingly. 

As a result the overall size of the resources will be significantly decreased.
 
Feature list:
	* In each run, group textures, which have similar properties,
	to one or more texture atlases.
	* Maximum atlas size as an input.
	* Five different packing algorithms.
	* Different image formats as input like RGB, JPEG, PNG. Oracle's OrdImage 
	is also supported.
	* Different image output formats based on transparency of its content.

Different packing algorithms:
	TPIM:
		TPIM is customized version of Touching Perimeter algorithm 
		as a heuristic two-dimensional bin packing with support of rotation. 
		During tests 83.35% of result atlas was occupied. This algorithm is 
		based on source code developed and released to the public by Jukka Jylänki.
					
		TPIM starts by sorting the items according to nonincreasing area and 
		their normal orientation. It initializes a bin with maximume acceptable 
		size and packs one item at a time. In the case that it is not possible 
		to add a new item to the current bin, a new bin will be initialized. The first 
		item packed in a bin is always placed in the bottom left corner. However 
		in the result atlas the orgin will be in the top left corner. Each item is 
		packed in a way that its bottom and left edges touching either the the bin 
		or the edge of another item.

		Each potential position for the new item will be scored as the amount 
		of its touching edges. Touching the bin edges gets more score to aviod 
		inhomogeneous shape of bin. For each candidate position the score will be 
		calculated twice for the two item orientations and the highest value 
		will be selected.

		Lodi A, Martello S, Vigo D. Heuristic and Metaheuristic Approaches 
		for a Class of Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problems. INFORMS J on 
		Computing 1999;11:345-357.
		
	TPIM_WITHOUT_ROTATION:
		It is an extension of TPIM algorithm which does not rotate textures.
			
	SLEA:
		Sleator's algorithm is a two-dimentional bin packing. It starts by packing
		all the items which has a width greater than half of the bin's width on top of
		each other. Then the remaining items will be sorted according to nonincreasing
		height. 
		The bin will be split to two halfs. Next items will be placed from left to right 
		in the left half and when it can not accomodate, the left half will be close and items 
		will be placed in right half. Next level of halfs, will be started with different botton
		height according to maximum height in previous level of left and rigth side.

		For more information please refer to:
		D. Sleator , A 2.5 times optimal algorithm for packing in two
		dimensions. Information Processing Letters 10 (1980), pp. 37-40.

	NFDH:
		The Next-Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) algorithm starts by sorting items according 
		to nonincreasing height. Then it packs a next item, left justified, 
		on the current level if it fits. Otherwise, the level is “closed”, and a new level 
		will be created (as a horizontal line drawn on the top of the tallest item packed 
		on the current level), and the item is packed, left justified, on it.

	FFDH:
		The First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) algorithm starts by sorting items according 
		to nonincreasing height. It packs the next item, left justified, on the first level 
		where it fits. If there is not any level to accommodate it, a new level is created
		as in NFDH.

RGB Endocder:
	The SGI Image format is supported by this API. An encoder is developed based on file format
	specification version 1.00 written by Paul Haeberli from Silicon Graphics Computer Systems.
	The encoder supports most of RGB images, but not all of them. For more information about the
	file format please refer to http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/sgirgb/sgiversion.html (active 
	in 2011).

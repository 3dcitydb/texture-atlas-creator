Texture Atlas Creator v0.3 

This program makes texture atlases from textures of each building
in a CityGML file and modifies it. This program is free software and

3. About
--------

This program is a standalone tool for modifying CityGML files and 
making texture atlases for all entire buildings.
It will compact several (as much as possible) texture images together
into one or several atlases (depending on atlas' size settings) and 
adapt texture coordinates accordingly. As a result the overall size 
of the resources (both CityGML and texture image files) will be 
significantly decreased. In addition, as an effect of using texture 
atlases the loading time of modified CityGML files will considerably 
decreased in viewers.
  
Features:
	* For each building, group textures, which have similar properties,
	to one or more texture atlases.
	* Maximum atlas size as an input.
	* Five different packing algorithms.  	
	* Accepts a folder as an input and parses it and its sub-folders 
	for valid CityGML files.
	* Detailed output shown in console. 
	* Different image formats as input like RGB, JPEG, PNG.
	* Different image output formats based on transparency of its content.
	
Notes:	
	* Wrapping textures, which have a coordinate out of the range [0,1],
	will not be modified.
	* TexCoordGen and GeoreferencedTexture are not supported.
	* Input CityGML files MUST be well-formed and validated based on 
	its official schema.
	
	
	
4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.5
* 1GB Main Memory 
	- Otherwise modify the BATCH file by changing -Xms1024m and -Xmx1024m
	to maximum possible size depends on your system.

  
5. How to use it
----------------

Simply run the batch file with options according to your desired result.

Command:
	TAC [/A algorithm] [/W max_width /H max_height] input output
	
Options:
	[/A algorithm]  
			Choose a packing algorithm from following list. It will be
			used during atlas creation.
			algorithm:
				TPIM
				TPIM_WOR
				SLEA
				NFDH
				FFDH
			(Default algorithm is TPIM)
				
	[/W max_width /H max_height] 
			Maximum size of texture atlas.		
			(Default size width:2048 and height:2048)
		
	input	
			Path of input CityGML file or folder. In the case of using
			folder, all sub folders will be parsed by program to find 
			CityGML files.
	output  
			Path of input CityGML file or folder. Structure of Input 
			folder will be reproduced in the output folder 
	
Examples:
	
	TAC /A TPIM /W 2048 /H 2048 c:/test_case c:/results
	
	TAC c:/test_case c:/results
	
	TAC /test_case /results
